// named export
// export let apiKey = "testApiKey"; 

// default export
// export default "testApiKey";  

// can have multiple named exports, but just one default export 
export default "testApiKey";
export let abc = "abc";
export let test = "test";

// It is possible to export functions too, which is what we mostly do in React
